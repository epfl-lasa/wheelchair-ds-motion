# wheelchair-ds-motion
DS-based motion planning (including obstacle avoidance) for the quickie-salsa wheelchair simulated in Gazebo.

## Instructions
**Step 1** Bring-up Gazebo Wheelchair Simulator and RViz for DS Visualization  
```
$ roslaunch wheelchair_ds_motion ds_simulation.launch
```
To change the 'world' configurations to include obstacles change the following variables:
```xml
	<arg name="no_obstacle" default="true"/>
	<arg name="one_obstacle" default="false"/>
	<arg name="multi_obstacles" default="false"/>
```

**Step 2 (Option 1)** To run a simple linear DS with obstacle avoidance:
```
$ roslaunch wheelchair_ds_motion run_linearDS_controller.launch 
```
To define the attractor and if obstacles should be present or not, modify the following line:
```xml
<arg name="ctrl_command"   default="10 0 1" />
```
- parameters: ``<x-position of attractor> <y-position of attractor> <number of obstacles> ``

Without obstacle avoidance, simply set the last parameter to 0.
  

**Step 2 (Option 2)** To run a non-linear DS (lpv formulation) with streamline visualization in rviz:
- Load the DS model
	```
	$ roslaunch wheelchair_ds_motion run_nonlinearDS_controller.launch 
	```
	The attractor and type of DS must are set in this parameter:
	```xml
	arg name="DS_name" value="2D-W-Nav-2"/>
	```
	which points to the ``.yml`` file in the [ds-motion-generator](https://github.com/epfl-lasa/ds_motion_generator) package.

- Control the wheelchair with this loaded DS, run the following command:
	```
	$ rosrun wheelchair_ds_motion nonlinearDS_controller.py
	```
	To define if obstacle should be present or not, add the following argument:
	```
	$ rosrun wheelchair_ds_motion nonlinearDS_controller.py <number of obstacles> 
	```
