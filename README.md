# wheelchair-ds-motion
DS-based motion planning (including obstacle avoidance) for the quickie-salsa wheelchair simulated in Gazebo.

## Instructions
1. Bring-up Gazebo Wheelchair Simulator and RViz for DS Visualization
	```
	$ roslaunch wheelchair_ds_motion ds_simulation.launch
	```
	To change the 'world' configurations to include obstacles change the following variables:
	```xml
		<arg name="no_obstacle" default="true"/>
		<arg name="one_obstacle" default="false"/>
		<arg name="multi_obstacles" default="false"/>
	```

2. To run a simple linear DS with obstacle avoidance:
	```
	$ rosrun wheelchair_ds_motion simple_velocity_controller.py 8 0 1
	```
	parameters: <x-position of attractor> <y-position of attractor> <number of obstacles>

	Without obstacle avoidance, simply set the last parameter to 0.
